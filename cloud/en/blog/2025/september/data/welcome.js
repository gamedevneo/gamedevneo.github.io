I use Zorin OS (a Linux version), which runs smoothly. I also have an internet connection and many PDF books to help me learn C++ programming, OpenGL, Vulkan, game engines, and game development. I even have books on graphic programming, OpenGL, and Vulkan. Plus, I’ve downloaded the SDL library and have its book too."
